# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

## Description

For this project I wanted to build a website using all what I studied in Lecture 0 and lecture 1. So, I built
a website that shows some information about me. Basicly a portafolio showing my education, experience and a way of contact. This is pretty simple and just to show that I can use what I learned in lecture.
